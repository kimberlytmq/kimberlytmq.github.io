          <h3>Conservation Ambassador</h3>
          <p>
            I’ve been volunteering with Mandai Wildlife Reserve since I was 15,
            serving as a Conservation Ambassador. As an ambassador, I engage
            guests at the Singapore Zoo, sharing stories about the animals and
            raising awareness about wildlife conservation. I’ve always loved
            animals and doing my part for the environment, and it’s been
            incredibly fulfilling to inspire others to care for wildlife too.
            These days, I’m usually stationed along the Wild Africa trail, where
            I talk to guests about African animals such as the cheetahs,
            giraffes, lions, and zebras. Beyond my regular duties, I also help
            out with special campaigns and events across the Mandai parks. For
            example, I participated in World Rhino Day, educating visitors about
            white rhinos and the importance of rejecting products made from
            rhino horns.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most exciting things I got to work on as a volunteer was
            the opening of Bird Paradise. Before the opening, I helped to clean
            the aviaries before the birds were moved in. We helped to remove
            leftover construction materials like nails and small plastics to
            ensure the safety of the birds. It was nice to get a sneak peak of
            the park before it opened to the public, and it was especially
            unique to see the aviary without birds and guests. During the big
            move from Jurong Bird Park, I assisted in cleaning bird carriers and
            observing the birds as they settled into their new aviaries,
            monitoring their behaviour and ensuring that newly introduced
            species were adapting well together.

          <h3>Zookeeper</h3>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            During my 2025 summer break, I joined the Keeper Volunteer
            Programme, where I got to experience life behind the scenes as a
            zookeeper. I was joined the Marsupials and Small Mammals team,
            caring for kangaroos, tree kangaroos, otters, and my personal
            favourite — the rock hyrax.
          </p>
          <p>
            My days were filled with hands-on husbandry work: cleaning
            enclosures, feeding animals, preparing enrichment activities, and
            assisting with welfare checks and training. I even got to help weigh
            kangaroos, feed meerkats, and watch baby otters grow up! It was such
            an enriching and eye-opening experience, and I’m so grateful to the
            Marsupials and Small Mammals team for guiding me throughout.

          <h3>Volunteering at Mercylight Shelter</h3>
          <p>
            As part of the Paws 4 a Cause initiative at Residential College 4, I
            volunteered with Mercylight shelter, where I helped care for over 50
            dogs. On Fridays after classes, we’d head to the shelter to walk the
            dogs, often doing several rounds so each one could enjoy their time
            outdoors. After that, we’d help with feeding, cleaning, and tending
            to wounds or applying medication. For some of the older dogs, we
            used heat packs to ease their pain and improve mobility. We’d end
            the evening with a final walk before preparing their bedding for the
            night. It was tiring at times, especially going straight from
            classes to the shelter and helping out until nightfall, but it was
            also incredibly fulfilling. I really loved spending time with the
            dogs. Each one had such a unique personality, and they were all so
            sweet in their own ways.
          </p>
          <h3>Web Development for Love the Voiceless</h3>
          <p>
            Alongside that, I also volunteered with Love the Voiceless as part
            of their web development team. We built a website using React to
            showcase dogs available for adoption. It was really meaningful to be
            able to use my technical skills to contribute to a cause I care
            about.
