          <p>
            During my six-month overseas internship with Gapai under the NUS
            Overseas Colleges Indonesia programme, I had the opportunity to work
            as a front-end software engineering intern in Jakarta. Gapai is a
            start-up that connects locals with overseas job opportunities, and
            as part of the small, dynamic team of about 25 members, I was able
            to contribute meaningfully while also gaining a close understanding
            of how each department in a start-up functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my role, I worked on both independent projects and smaller UI
            enhancements following internal audits. One of my most notable
            projects was developing a testing environment for Gapai’s new AI
            Interviewer product. This environment enabled the entire company to
            test the product simultaneously, allowing us to evaluate concurrency
            and performance under load. It was rewarding to see colleagues
            across the company use a system I built, and to know that my work
            directly supported the product’s development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another key contribution I made was implementing a tracking system
            for the AI Interviewer. This system monitored and logged issues such
            as connection drops, focus loss when users switched applications,
            and agent buffering errors. By capturing this data, the team was
            able to better understand user behaviour and identify areas for
            product improvement.

            Beyond the technical experience, I truly valued working in a
            start-up environment where transparency and collaboration were
            integral. Monthly company-wide meetings allowed every department to
            share updates, giving me a broader perspective of the business as a
            whole, which is something I might not have experienced in a larger
            organisation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Living in Jakarta also enriched my experience immensely. Alongside
            my internship, I took classes at Universitas Indonesia on business
            feasibility studies, where I connected with peers who had innovative
            ideas for the rapidly developing Indonesian market. I also explored
            the city’s vibrant start-up scene through events and competitions,
            and immersed myself in the culture by learning conversational Bahasa
            Indonesia, which was widely used both in the workplace and in daily
            life.

            This internship was truly a unique experience that allowed me to
            develop both technical and soft skills. It strengthened my ability
            to work in a fast-paced, resource-constrained environment, improved
            my adaptability, and gave me invaluable cross-cultural exposure. I
            believe the skills and perspectives I gained during this time will
            continue to shape my growth and contribute positively to my future
            career.

            During my time at RC4, I took on multiple leadership roles and
            directed three major college-wide events: Arts Night Runway,
            Informal Dinner, and Residential Colleges Horror Night. Each one
            pushed me in different ways, but they were all really rewarding
            experiences.

            <p><span>Arts Night Runway</span></p>
            <p>
              Arts Night is our annual showcase for music, dance, and theatre,
              and as Head of the Fashion and Sewing Club, I got to create and
              direct a fashion runway segment. It was hectic pulling everything
              together on a tight timeline, from coordinating models, sewers,
              designers, and the main event committee, to finishing my own
              design, but seeing it all come together on stage made the stress
              worth it.

            <p>
              This is a biannual themed dinner for residents, and I directed a
              Back to School edition for around 350 people. I worked with many
              different groups: my own events committee, dining hall staff,
              performers, sound engineers, and college staff. Even when we hit a
              few technical hiccups, the event ran smoothly and was praised by
              residents for its nostalgic theme, performances, and immersive
              atmosphere.

            <p><span>Residential Colleges Horror Night </span></p>
            <p>
              This was the biggest event that I had ever directed. As a
              collaboration between all 5 residential colleges with about 1,000
              attendees, it was a daunting event to take up. I oversaw RC4’s
              haunted house while also coordinating with the other colleges to
              make sure everything ran safely and on theme. I also introduced
              two new systems that helped streamline operations and improve
              safety:
            </p>
            <p>
              1. A Telegram queue system, so people didn’t have to stand in long
              physical lines without knowing if they’d even get to go into the
              haunted houses.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. A two-part haunted house design for our RC4 house, which made
              the experience faster without losing the scares. More people could
              go through, more scare actors could be involved, and feedback was
              much better than in past years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, these events taught me a lot about leading teams,
              handling logistics, and coming up with creative solutions under
              pressure. It was stressful at times, but the energy on the event
              day and the positive feedback from residents and committee members
              made it all worth it.
